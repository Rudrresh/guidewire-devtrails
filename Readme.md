# Kubernetes Failure Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains an XGBoost model trained to predict failures in a Kubernetes environment. The model leverages key metrics such as resource utilization, network performance, and log anomalies to predict potential issues with pods and nodes.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Training Data**: 100,000 rows of synthetic Kubernetes telemetry data
- **Target Variable**: `issue` (categorical or binary classification indicating failure occurrence)

## Dataset

The model was trained on a synthetic dataset with the following characteristics:

- **Number of Samples**: 100,000
- **Features**:
  - `timestamp`: Time of data collection
  - `cpu_usage`: CPU utilization of the pod/node
  - `memory_usage`: Memory utilization
  - `disk_usage`: Disk utilization
  - `network_io`: Network input/output activity
  - `pod_status`: Status of the pod
  - `node_status`: Status of the node
  - `latency_ms`: Measured network latency in milliseconds
  - `error_rate`: Error rate observed
  - `logs_anomalies`: Count of detected anomalies in logs
- **Target Variable**: `issue` (indicating a failure event or potential problem)

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **Other Metrics**:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared Score
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score (if classification)

## Requirements

To run the model, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

- **Python Version**: 3.8+
- **Libraries**:
  - XGBoost 1.5.0
  - Scikit-learn 1.0.2
  - Pandas 1.3.5
  - NumPy 1.21.5

## Usage

1. **Load the trained model**:
   ```python
   import pickle
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler

   # Load models
   with open("models/kubernetes_issue_classifier.pkl", "rb") as f:
       model = pickle.load(f)
   with open("models/label_encoder.pkl", "rb") as f:
       label_encoder = pickle.load(f)
   with open("models/scaler.pkl", "rb") as f:
       scaler = pickle.load(f)

   # Load new data
   new_data = pd.read_csv("new_kubernetes_data.csv")
   
   # Preprocess new data
   new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)
   
   # Make predictions
   predictions = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
   predictions = label_encoder.inverse_transform(predictions)
   print(predictions)
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Enhance dataset with real-world Kubernetes failure logs.
- Implement anomaly detection techniques for better feature engineering.
- Optimize hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization.
